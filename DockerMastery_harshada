            section 3
                some basic commands
                difference between image(binary, library, code) and container (running instance of that image)
                docker's default image 'registry' calledas docker hub
            lecture 20:
                80:80 port is already in use so tried to use different port, but its not working until previously created nginx image was not killed
                    (use of netstat tool for searching which port is used by which service)
                created nginx image, uses some commands and removed it
            lecture 21:
                working of container in background(looks for image,else download,create new container,gives new virtual IP inside docker engine)
            lecture 26:
                container commands = top, inspect, stats

            lecture 31:
                use of DNS for intercommunaction of container rathr than using IP
                create own network rather than using default

            section 5
                solution of persistant container is volumes and data mounts.
                volumes are like outside momory of container can attach to any container
                we store important data in it, volumes should delete manually.
                data is stored on unique location. we cant see that by going to that location , its created on VM.
                the purpose of -v option in running container to give a name to a volume or to use same volume for further ,to identify it.
                by using -v command after a runing container is some times necessary to configure a driver options. 
                assignment on running container with named volume
                assignment : use jekyll static site generator to start local web server

            section 6
                    docker compose is an combination of command line tool and a configuration file
                    it configures relationship between containers as we need to run container with combinations like backend,frontend,sql etc
                    saves docker container run setting in easy to read file
                    YAML can be used with docker compose for local docker automation or production with swarm
                    YAML syntax
                    docker-compose commands
                    assignment of writing yaml file and dockerfile for install and configure drupal

            section 7
                swarm is server clustering solution which brings multiple hosts together into single unit
                created swarm clusters using play-with-docker.combination

            section 8
                created 2 services on swarm and it distributed over node
                something about overlay network
                it does load balancing for us(uses virtual IP), and also in overlay network all swarm nodes listen to a external traffic, route the info to particular container, it helps during if any container fails dont need to configure everything again
                how to replicate the service on all node(load balancing)
                basics of how to create a multinode swarm and overlay network(assignment)
                what is stack. 
                secure solution for storing secreats
                storing secreats to use by services,container and stack

            section 9
                we can also use secret with compose file without swarm. just like using compose file used in swarm but its not that much secure.
                we can write everything in one compose file, but it will become quite complicated
                solution is we can use multiple .yml file
                docker can read .yml and .override.yml bydefault
                I have read docs.docker.com for this but didnot understood much
                some update commands
                healthcheck command
                three states are there = starting, healthy, unhealthy
                by using healthcheck docker can check the container is running or not.
                it adds new field in docker container ls

                docker hub for automatic biuld of an images
                docker store 
                docker cloude  =for swarm and cluster, use for building and testing images
